﻿Introduction
  
In today's digital landscape, the paramount concern is providing secure and convenient communication services while ensuring data integrity. Our project addresses this challenge by constructing a chat system that prioritizes security and privacy. The system employs a range of sophisticated techniques to safeguard information during transmission.

Key Features

Secure Messaging: Messages are encrypted using both RSA and AES, ensuring end-to-end security.

Steganography: LSB steganography is integrated with AES to hide messages within images or audio files.

Self-Destruct Mechanism: Messages can be programmed to delete themselves after a specified period, enhancing user privacy.

Automated Threat Detection: Machine learning algorithms analyze user behavior and automatically blacklist suspicious IPs.

Enhanced Authentication: JWT is implemented for robust user authentication.

Performance Optimization: Redis and message queues are utilized to boost message handling speed and system performance.

Scalable Architecture: The system is designed using a microservices architecture and deployed with Kubernetes for high availability and easy maintenance.
